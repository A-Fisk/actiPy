- periodogram functions
    Enright
    Lomb scargle
    ?
- Analysis functions
    - Intra variability
    - Inter stability
        - Old version
        - My version? to be developed 
- Episode detection
- Episode analysis?
    - Mean/Median duration
    - Distribution


### What do we have
 



### How do we get there

- Actogram
Bunch of different functions to call based on shape of dataframe input
Main plotting function is _actogram_plot

What do we need?
Documentation - better description of what all parameters do, their 
default values and what type of data is expected?

Tidy up code? Refactor see if can be done better?

Look at other functions and figure out what is actually needed


- General
- Write list of all functions in each file
